            <h144><p>The moment you login to your account, you can start organizing what is most important to you. You will have the option to either create a new reminder, or a new entry. Reminders are good for short-term urgent thoughts that you want posted on your home page. Reminders can be ranked by importance, ensuring that the most relevant reminders are displayed on your home page, preventing you from forgetting or accidently abandoning the important stuff.  Entries on the other hand are good for long-term plans. A single entry could serve as an organization space for a university course, an upcoming summer holiday, or renovation plans for your home. When you go to add a new entry, you will fill out a form which then nicely lays out the important information which you have submitted. The form gives you the opportunity to divide information into the sections 'Key Information', 'Main Content', and 'To-Do' as well as a space for a photo (if you don't wish to add a photo for your entry, a default one will be uploaded). For an entry, you can also leave progress reports to remind your future self of today's progress, and of what still requires attention. </p></h144>
